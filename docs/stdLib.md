# Standard Library
Extensibella contains a standard library for working with built-in
types, written in Abella directly.  In addition to defining
Extensibella's built-in datatypes and operations on them, it proves
properties about them that can be used in proofs.

The standard library can be found in the [`stdLib`
directory](../stdLib).  To generate the documentation for the theorems
proven in the standard library, run the [`build_docs`
script](../stdLib/build_docs) in the standard library directory.  This
will produce a Markdown documentation file listing the theorems.
