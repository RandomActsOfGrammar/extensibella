Extensibella relies on generated encodings of languages, which are
presumed to be written in some other specification system.  It also
relies on compiling proofs for language components to know about the
imported theorems it can use and those it must prove.  For both of
these, we need a place to put the results where we can find them when
proving.  This directory is that place.
